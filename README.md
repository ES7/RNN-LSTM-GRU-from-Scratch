# RNN-LSTM-GRU-from-Scratch
This project involves the implementation of RNN, LSTM, and GRU models from scratch using PyTorch for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. The goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of these recurrent neural network architectures, train them on a popular dataset for sentiment analysis, and visualize their computational graphs using `torchviz`. The project explores the theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and training processes of these models, aiming to provide insights into their effectiveness in natural language processing tasks.
